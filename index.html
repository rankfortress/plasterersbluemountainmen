	Plastering is a task that plasterers often undertake. It can be done on new homes, extensions to existing ones, and commercial property renovations. Plasterboard needs two coats; first, you need to make it then it’s time for the first coat of plaster finish.Plastering is a tricky job that requires two coats of plaster. The first coat mostly goes on with either a trowel or putty knife, and the second coat needs to be sanded off for it to have an even surface. In some cases where there are curves in the wall, you may need three coats rather than just two! Plasterers also do drywall installations along with installing gyprock boards onto new homes as well as attaching them over existing walls if they’re being extended outwards into another room.Your home is your castle. That’s why we aim to make it as beautiful and functional as possible, no matter the project or budget– from walls and ceilings to floors, doors, windows – you name it!
